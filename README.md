# AWS Intro


## First Notes on AWS - What is AWS?


On-demand cloud platform; dbs, code, renting services and servers and whatnot
pay only for what you use and whatnot
Cloud compute indeed; I don't need to plug wires in
AWS provisions HW vitrually. Super easy scaled and cloud compute don't need datacenter ops and whatnot
region, like us-east-1 which is a big datacenter essentially;
multiple availability zones; can usually choose regions to then meet latency and compliance needs and stuff
Like choosing CA est or central; european servers and whatnot


#### Benefits

- Auto scaling
- Cost, pay for only what you need
- Less OPS; hand over whatever you need
- Really good compliance; use Amazon's massive security eco-system

Like wwhat you've used Amazon Lambda to process data at work


supercell and clash royale.

### Services Compute, dev tools, EC2

EC2: Virtual servers, full OS, network control, flexibles

Lambda: serverless functions, serving requests, no server mngmt, pure compute

S3: Database, object storage, files, logs, uploads and backups

RDS: SQL. relational values, tables, PostgresSQl, mysql

DynamoDB: No SQL, key value; single digit ms latency


SQL for relational models; noSQL when looking at hgi-scale simple requests


API gateway; REST GraphQL and whatnot; ----> backend; database private subnet; public subnet with the compute


Dev tools:

codebuild, pipline, deploy, cloudwatch; CI/CD, really for devtools and whatnot



AI/ML stuff

sagemaker

ECS: Elastic container services: run docker wothout running your own control plane

EKS: Elastic kubernetes service; managed kube services


sagemaker is for data, prep, tuning, endpoints in one platform

Rekognition: prebuilt image/videao analusos,



### Career pathways; 



Pretty much good at u


- Frontend

Hosting an app; speed ; cloudfront


- Backend

lamdba and api gateway, ecs and eks
databases on certain subnets, cloud watch for monitoring and whatnot

- Full-Stack

bla




- DevOps

CI/CD; pipelines, infra; amazon's platforms certainly makes more sense and whatnot 


- Mobile App Dev

AMplify, all of reaching users closely indeed; app sync, graphQl apis dyncamic data
focus on design


- ML eng

training models, S3 for data and 

EC2 to handle training and compute; lambda for functions 



- Game developer

quick response rates
